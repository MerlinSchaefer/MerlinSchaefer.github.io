  I created this blog to write about projects and learning material, find like-minded people, receive constructive feedback, hold myself accountable and maybe even inspire.
  After multiple things in my personal life pushed writing about my journey into the background I now I am to write at least once every two weeks.
  
  **Right now it's basically under construction and will be converted to a portfolio website soon. To see what I have been up to visit me on** [GitHub](https://github.com/MerlinSchaefer) or [Medium](https://ms101196.medium.com/)
