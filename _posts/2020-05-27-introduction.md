Who am I? What am I doing here?
====================

My name is Merlin Sch√§fer. I am currently a 6th semester psychology student at HU Berlin, Germany.
During the last year I discovered an increasing interest into all things "data" and "machine learning". 
I realize those words are buzzwords, and although I think there is some reason to be buzzed about them creating the 20th article about how data is the new gold/oil/religion is not my goal.
I created this blog for a couple of reasons:
- I want to track my progress
- I want to hold myself accountable
- I want to share my ideas,thoughts and projects and possibly inspire or at least inform someone 
- I want to have a blog, because, why not
- I want my work to be somewhere besides my harddrive (and possible some MOOC assignment submission server directory)

Well, I guess those are my reasons, some more important and more inspiring then others.


I learned a lot over the past few month, and the first couple posts will basically be about what I have done (mainly within courses) so far.

For example this silly little matplotlib animation:

After that I will try to post about current or recently concluded work.
If I feel like giving my 2 cents about a topic or rambling about something I might just do that as well (as long as it's related to this blogs topic).

**DISCLAIMER**

I am by no means a Programming, Data-Science or Machine Learning professional. I am documenting my *journey* through all of these (and possibly more) topics. I believe that I am still at the beginning of my journey. 
Therefore:
- code examples might not be clean
- solutions and end results may not be perfect
- errors will occur
- constructive criticism is welcome
- I will help where I can, but may be unable to for some topics

What have I done so far?
------------------------
I guess my journey started in my first semester of university. Other then many of my fellow students I enjoyed the statistics and R lectures.
My interest in data and statistics related topics remained steady but didn't go beyond the stuff taught within my degree. 

Until I stumble upon Python, the topic of Data Science and Machine Learning. I don't really remember exactly when and how, but it happened.

I started to learn some basic python.

I read "The Master Algorithm" by Pedro Domingos.

I listened to the "Machine learning guide" Podcast by OCDEVEL on my daily way to university.

Then I completed some of the basic tutorials on kaggle to get familiar with the actual "hands-on" work. And read some more stuff, watched Youtube videos etc.

I consider these steps my very basic foundation which sparked interest and gave me some tools to go further.
The next step in my journey was the Machine Learning Course taught by Andrew Ng, which I will cover in a seperate post.

For now I thank you for reading this and hope to see you next time.
