Machine Learning by Andrew Ng
====================

When you stumble across Machine Learning and AI, which, seeing how you are here, I assume you have, you might ask yourself: 
- "Can I learn this?"
- "Where can I learn this?"
- "How much will time and money it cost me?"
- etc.

If you are not only keeping these questions in your head but ask someone or Google, you can't really "avoid" a recommendation to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera. For a reason.
Although the course is a little dated and won't teach you cutting edge AI and Deep Learning techniques it is one of the best, if not the best introductions to Machine Learning.

It was my first "real" course on machine learning and one of the starting points of my journey.

You can check out the course here:
<https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning>

The course will introduce you to basic topics and common (shallow) learning algorithms over the Course of 11 weeks (or less). Prof Ng will guide you through the theory and math behind these techniques.
Now I know, the word math does not ring well with some people and I get it. While I never hated math, it was never my favorite subject and in school I only liked a few select topics. 
However although some formulas in the course are not trivial Andrew Ng does his best to walk you through them and "if you don't fully understand them right now that's fine" - Andrew Ng (in many Videos)

I mean who wouldn't understand this:

Jokes aside, you will come to love these slides and Prof. Ng's elaborate and sometimes creative additions to them, as they really do help you understand everything step by step.

Now, what does the course cover?
- Regression (Linear,Polynomial)
- Logistic Regression (classification)
- Regularization
- Neural Networks
- SVMs (Support Vector Machines)
- k-means clustering
- PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)
- Anomaly Detection
- Recommender Systems
- some info on ML on a larger scale
- Matlab/Octave (if you do the Programming Exercises)


These topics are discussed across 11 weeks, however you can learn at your own pace and if time allows it finish it in less time.

Every week you will encounter mostly Videos as learning material, at the end of each week you will have to pass a quiz and at some point a programming assignment as well.

These quizzes and assignments only apply to you if you want to earn a certificate, which is **not** free. All videos however are freely available if you just want to audit the course.

The assignments are for Matlab/Octave which has it's pros and cons.
You will learn or have to learn to implement the algorithms more or less from scratch which can be valuable to understanding them. This however is done in Matlab/Octave which is not state-of-the-art when it comes to deploying ML-models. For that you should learn Python or R.
I personally didn't like Matlabs syntax as it was not as intuitive as Python.
If you decide to work on the assignments you will probably get stuck at some point, which is fine. Head over to the forums and search for your problem, the answer or at least a hint is probably there.


### My Personal Experience with the course

I learned a lot from this course. It covers the theory and math behind the algorithms which a lot of courses that teach you scikit-learn etc. do not. I believe it is important to a least have a basic understanding of the "inner workings" of the ML-algorithms you employ, if you think the same, this course will be a good starting point.
I was not a fan of the programming assignments, but they did help to deepen my understanding of the algorithms, especially when it comes to what can go wrong.
Andrew Ng is a fantastic teacher, his subtle exitement is contagious, his explanations clear and his good-bye in the last video was touching.


For me the course was a kind of inbetween step in my learning path which layed a solid foundation. Before I had learned some theoretical things about ML, knew some techniques like regression and PCA through my university studies and had also already used python and sci-kit learn for some prediciton within the Kaggle Mini-Courses. After completing this course I focused on learning to use Python for Data Science, ML and AI.

I recommend this course as a starting point before jumping into using Python or R to solve ML-problems or as a supplement while you learn to use more state-of-the-art methods. If you take itI am pretty sure you won't regret it.
