I am currently studying Data Science (remote) at the Rome Business School. I have finished my Bachelors Degree in Psychology . I also continue to work in a consulting firm for the public sector and as a volunteer for TechLabs e.V. I am  reading, coding, writing etc. to broaden as well as deepen my knowledge of the world and all things Data/ML/AI.

**Right now the blog/website is under construction and will be converted to a portfolio website soon. To see what I have been up to visit me on** [GitHub](https://github.com/MerlinSchaefer) or [Medium](https://ms101196.medium.com/).

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it was inspired by [the /now movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). If you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.
