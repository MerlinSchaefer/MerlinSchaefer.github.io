I am currently starting my (remote) Masters Degree in Data Science at the Rome Business School. I have finished my Bachelors Degree in Psychology. I also continue to work in a consulting firm for the public sector and as a volunteer for TechLabs e.V. I am  reading, coding, etc. to broaden as well as deepen my knowledge of the world and all things Data/ML/AI.

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it was inspired by [the /now movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). If you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.
