I am currently waiting for answer to my Masters applications. I have finished my Bachelor and am only waiting for the last points and grades to be entered into the system, so that I can receive my degree. Whilst waiting I continue to work in a consulting firm for the public sector. I am also reading, coding, etc. to broaden as well as deepen my knowledge of the world and all things Data/ML/AI.

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it was inspired by [the /now movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). If you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.
